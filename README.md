This code block handles the display of file sizes in a PowerShell script. Let's break down what it does:

The code first checks if any large files were found by displaying a message with the count of files that exceed the $MinSize parameter, shown in green text using Write-Host with the -ForegroundColor parameter.

For each file in the $largeFiles collection, the script determines how to display its size using a series of conditional checks. If $ShowSizeInMB is true, it forces all file sizes to be shown in megabytes (MB). This is useful for consistency in output formatting.

If $ShowSizeInMB is false, the script uses a cascading series of size thresholds to display the file size in the most appropriate unit:

Files 1GB or larger are shown in gigabytes
Files 1MB or larger (but less than 1GB) are shown in megabytes
Files smaller than 1MB are shown in kilobytes
The [math]::Round() method is used to format the sizes to 2 decimal places for readability. Each file is displayed on a new line with its full path followed by its size and unit (GB, MB, or KB).

This approach provides a human-friendly way to display file sizes, automatically scaling to the most appropriate unit of measurement unless specifically told to use megabytes via the $ShowSizeInMB parameter.
